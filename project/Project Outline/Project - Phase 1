Phase 1: Implement User and Security (JWT) and Test Endpoints

Create User Model

Define the User model with attributes like ID, Username, Password, and any other user-related information needed for your library system.
Create UserProfile Model

If you want to associate user profiles with registered users in your library system, define the UserProfile model with relevant attributes.
Connect User Model to UserProfile Model

Establish a relationship between the User model and the UserProfile model. You might use a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship, depending on your requirements.
Generate Default Constructor, Getters, Setters, and toString for UserProfile Model

Implement the basic constructor and accessor methods for the UserProfile model.
Create Default Constructor, Getters, Setters, and toString for User Model

Implement the basic constructor and accessor methods for the User model.
Create User Repository

Define a repository interface for the User model to perform database operations. Include custom JPA methods as needed.
Create Methods in User Service

Implement methods in the user service layer to handle user-related operations specific to your library system. Start with a POST method for user registration.
Create User Controller Endpoints

Define controller endpoints for user registration and other user-related actions within the context of your library system.
Test with POSTMAN (200, 409)

Use POSTMAN to test the user registration endpoint, ensuring it returns the expected status codes (200 for success, 409 for conflicts).
Add Spring Security to POM.xml

Include the Spring Security dependency in your project's pom.xml file.
Set Security Configuration

Configure Spring Security settings for your library system, such as specifying which endpoints require authentication.
Add PasswordEncoder Bean in UserService

Implement a PasswordEncoder bean for securely hashing passwords.
Test with POSTMAN (200, 409)

Test the authentication endpoint (e.g., login) using POSTMAN, ensuring it returns the correct status codes.
Verify Encrypted Password from the H2 Database

Confirm that user passwords are securely hashed and stored in the H2 database.
Add Find by Email Address

Implement a method to find users by their email addresses, which can be useful in the context of a library system.
Implement UserDetails and UserDetailsService

Implement the UserDetails interface and create a UserDetailsService tailored to your library system.
Update POM.xml and application-dev.properties

Update your project's configuration files to integrate Spring Security within your library API.
Add JWTUtils and JwtRequestFilter

Implement utility classes for handling JWTs and create a filter for JWT authentication, which may be specific to your library system's needs.
Updated Security Configuration

Configure Spring Security settings, including JWT authentication, in a way that aligns with your library system's requirements.
Add LoginRequest and LoginResponse

Define request and response objects for user login, considering any specific data you need to include in these objects for your library system.
Update UserService and UserController

Modify the service and controller to handle user login and other user-related actions within the context of your library system.
Test Create New User Endpoint and Login Endpoint

Test the user registration and login endpoints with POSTMAN, ensuring they return the expected results in the context of your library API.
