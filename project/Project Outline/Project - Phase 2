Phase 2: Implement Core Functionality

1. Create Category Model:
Create a Category class in your project's model package.
Annotate the class with @Entity.
Add attributes like id, name, and any other relevant attributes.
Use appropriate annotations to specify the primary key.

2. CategoryRepository:
Create a CategoryRepository interface in the repository package.
Extend it from JpaRepository<Category, Long> to provide CRUD operations for Category entities.
You can add custom queries if needed.

3. CategoryService:
Develop a CategoryService class in the service package.
Autowire the CategoryRepository into this service.
Implement methods for CRUD operations and any other category-related logic.

4. Create Book Model:
Create a Book class in your project's model package.
Annotate the class with @Entity.
Add attributes like id, title, author (you can use a ManyToOne relationship), category, isbn, description, and any other relevant attributes.
Use appropriate annotations to specify the primary key and relationships with Author and Category.

5. BookRepository:
Create a BookRepository interface in the repository package.
Extend it from JpaRepository<Book, Long> to provide CRUD operations for Book entities.
You can add custom queries if needed.

6. Author Model:
Create an Author class in your project's model package.
Annotate the class with @Entity.
Add attributes like id, firstName, lastName, biography, and any other relevant attributes.
Use appropriate annotations to specify the primary key.

7. AuthorRepository:
Create an AuthorRepository interface in the repository package.
Extend it from JpaRepository<Author, Long> to provide CRUD operations for Author entities.
You can add custom queries if needed.

8. AuthorService:
Develop an AuthorService class in the service package.
Autowire the AuthorRepository into this service.
Implement methods for CRUD operations and any other author-related logic.

9. BookService:
Develop a BookService class in the service package.
Autowire the BookRepository into this service.
Implement methods for CRUD operations and any other book-related logic.
You may need methods for searching books by title, author, or category.

10. API Endpoints for Books and Authors:
Define API endpoints for managing books and authors in your UserController or dedicated BookController and AuthorController.
Map these endpoints to appropriate methods in the BookService and AuthorService.
Implement endpoints such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting books and authors.
Apply authorization checks based on user roles (Admin, Public, Library Member) for each endpoint.
